			Installing Emacs OACS


1) Create a subdirectory called oacs in the emacs site-lisp
   directory. On most systems the full path to site-lisp is:

     /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp

   If the site-lisp directory is in a different location on your
   system then use your full path instead from here on in these
   installation instructions.

   If you use Bazaar NG you can follow the development of Emacs OACS by
   creating a local copy of the development branch like so:

     bzr get http://thecodemill.biz/repository/oacs

   If you install from an Emacs OACS tarball copy all extracted files
   to the oacs directory.

2) Install the Emacs nXML mode or the PSGML mode. PSGML is the default
   XML mode handler of OACS. Set the oacs-preferred-xml-mode variable
   to nxml to use nXML mode instead. nXML mode in my opinion is
   superior but your milage may varry.

   PSGML mode is available from:

     http://psgml.sourceforge.net/

   Follow the included installation instructions.

   Alternatively, Debian users can use:

     apt-get install psgml

   nXML mode is available from:

     http://thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/

3) Install the Emacs MMM mode. MMM is available from:

     http://mmm-mode.sourceforge.net/

   Alternatively, Debian users can use:

     apt-get install mmm-mode


4) Recommended but not required. Install color-occur by copying 

     http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/color-occur.el

   to the Emacs site-lisp directory.


5) Put the following line in your .emacs file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/oacs")
    (require 'oacs)


6) Customize the following Emacs variables

     user-full-name
     user-mail-address

   Type M-x customize-variable followed by the name of the variable to
   change their value. Be sure to save the new value for future
   sessions.


7) Restart Emacs.


8) Enjoy!
